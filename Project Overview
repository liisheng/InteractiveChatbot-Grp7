Your project must include basic functionalities such as data reading and writing, and it should
have a coherent and self-contained functionality.
The amount of work you put into the project is crucial, as we primarily assess the application
of Python.

Your project should also have specific highlights, such as:
- Data Visualization: The visualizations are particularly impressive or sophisticated.
- High Performance: The project excels in handling high concurrency and heavy loads,
demonstrated through experiments.
- Custom Models: The project incorporates custom models for data analysis,
showcasing advanced techniques or innovation.
etc.

If you are building on an existing project, you can improve it.
- How to enhance the functionality
- How to optimize the code structure design
- How your current project plan demonstrates improved accuracy and depth compared
to previous work
- In principle, we do not recommend doing this, but if you are disciplined enough, you
may have the opportunity to bring something closer to perfection.
- Do not lie to yourself

Make use of all available resources, tools, and time to create a well-rounded piece of work
that is both coherent and has standout features.

Focus on delivering a project that not only meets the basic requirements but also
demonstrates in-depth thinking and exceptional execution about real-world problems.




Project 7: Creating an Interactive Chatbot with APIs

Problem statement:
In this project, you will develop a chatbot using various APIs for text and voice interactions.
You can utilize OpenAI's API or any other suitable APIs for natural language processing, voice,
and multimedia interactions. The project can be extended to include 2D or 3D characters,
scenes, and animations to create a more engaging and interactive experience. This project
will help you learn about API integration, natural language processing, and basic 2D/3D
animation techniques.

Project Tasks:
1. Introduction to APIs:
Learn about different APIs available for text and voice interactions, including
OpenAI's API, Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, etc.
Understand how to authenticate and make API calls.

2. Setting Up the Development Environment:
Install necessary libraries (e.g., requests, Pygame, Blender, PyOpenGL).
Set up a Python development environment.

3. Basic Chatbot Implementation:
Create a simple chatbot that can respond to user inputs using a chosen text API.
Implement basic conversation handling and response generation.

4. Voice Integration (Optional):
Use a voice API (e.g., OpenAI's voice API, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech) to add
speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
Enable the chatbot to interact with users through voice commands and
responses.

5. 2D Character and Scene Creation (Optional):
Design a 2D character and background scenes using Pygame or similar libraries.
Animate the character to react to user inputs and chatbot responses.

6. 3D Character and Scene Creation (Optional):
Use Blender or PyOpenGL to create a 3D character and environment.
Implement basic animations and actions for the character based on chatbot
interactions.

7. Advanced Features and Customization:
Add personality and customization options for the chatbot.
Implement more complex conversation flows and handle different user intents.

8. Testing and Debugging:
Test the chatbot with various user inputs to ensure it responds correctly.
Debug any issues related to API integration, voice interaction, or animations.
